# CISC210-Stories

Create a story about the fireball game, create the JIRA issue, create a branch named from the story, write the story into this file
(README.md), and then do a pull request for your changes.

As a player, I want my fireballs to light the candles.

Acceptance Criteria:
When the fireball hits the candle, the wick is lit.
